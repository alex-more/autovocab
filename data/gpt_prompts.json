GrammarPoint is the grammar point (i.e: -보다), Example is an example sentence of the grammar point being used, Explanation is a short 1 sentence explanation of the grammar point (2 sentences max if needed), Translation is the shortest translation of the grammar point when applicable (in this case 'more than').",
